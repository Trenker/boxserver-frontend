# Boxserver Frontend

This is a simple HTML that uses XMLHTTPRequest to offer a GUI for a [boxserver](https://github.com/trenker/boxserver).

## Installation

Clone the repository, build it with the environment variable `BASEURL` set to the URL of your boxserver and place the HTML file `index.html` into the document root of your webserver

You will need gulp and bower to build it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/trenker/boxserver-frontend.git
cd boxserver-frontend

bower install
npm install

BASEURL="http://domain.tld:8001" gulp release
mv build/index.html /var/www/html/index.html
```

The GUI itself should be self explanatory
